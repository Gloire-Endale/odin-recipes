  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooking spray</li>
    <li>all-purpose flour for dusting</li>
    <li>1 (18.4 ounce) package brownie mix</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>¼ cup water</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 quart mint chocolate chip ice cream, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed (Optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.</li>
    <li>Combine brownie mix, oil, water, and eggs in a mixing bowl; stir well with a spoon until thickened and smooth, about 1 minute. Spread batter into the prepared cake pans.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until set and browned, about 30 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a pan should come out with moist crumbs. Let cool for 10 minutes in pans before removing to finish cooling on racks.

    </li>
    <li>After brownies are cool, remove ice cream from the freezer and allow to soften for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, pour sweetened condensed milk into a saucepan and mix in chocolate chips; heat over low heat, stirring constantly, just until chips have melted and sauce is smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool to barely warm temperature.

    </li>
    <li>Place one of the layers of brownies into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Evenly spread ice cream in a layer over brownies; pour and spread 1/2 of the chocolate sauce over ice cream. Top with the other brownie layer, and drizzle remaining sauce over the top.</li>
    <li>Freeze until ready to eat, at least 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Serve topped with whipped topping.</li>
  </ul>
