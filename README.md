========Odin Recipes===============

This is my first project from The Odin Projectâ€™s Foundations course. The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML. It will contain links to multiple recipe pages, each including text, images, and proper semantic structure.

=======What I'm Learning============

- Setting up a Git repository using SSH
- Cloning, committing, and pushing with Git
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages
- Using semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, etc.)
- Structuring content clearly and accessibly

=======Project Goals===================

- Build a simple and clean recipe website
- Develop good habits for using Git and GitHub
- Strengthen understanding of HTML fundamentals
